# Write one row of data into a table in SQL database 
# This sample allows you to write one row of data into a Fabric SQL Database 
# Complete these steps before testing this function: 
#   1. Select 'Manage connections' and add a connection to a Fabric SQL Database
#   2. Copy the Alias name and replace it inside the @udf.connection() decorator.
